 <h1 class="text-center">A little bit about myself</h1>
 <p class="text-center"> My name is Samantha Young and I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through 
design. I'm constantly learning new things everyday and love meeting people who are motivated and unafraid
 of sharing their ideas with the world.<br>
   I'm a self taught designer and have learnt a lot of the processes, concepts and theories of UX/UI and product design 
 through attending workshops, reading blogs and applying these to projects in my spare time and at work. I am very much a
  big-picture thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.

<div id="myvalues" class="mt-5 p-3 text-center">
 <h2>My values</h2>
 <h3>Passion is everything</h3>
 <p>If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. You are not a tree. Channel your energy into something you believe in.
  I'm fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people who enjoy what they do. We only have so much time on this 
  earth to live - so why waste it?</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Always be learning</h3>
  <p>Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to grow. I am always looking at ways to 
  challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like to participate in hackathons, read blogs, dabble in new 
  projects and attend meetups.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Embrace your creativity</h3>
  <p>Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane! When I'm not designing, I'm singing with the band,
   painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups realise their potential with design</p>
   <br>
  <h3>Stay humble</h3>
  <p>It doesn't matter whether you're the president, manager, homeless or average kid on the street. Treat others with 
  respect as you would yourself because ultimately we're all human sharing the same wants and needs and facing our own 
  battles everyday. Stay true to yourself and stay true to others.</p>
